When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with a team, when working from multiple computers, etc.
Basically any time a file or project might invole multiple development computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Becuase the changes might alter or break something you are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is used on GitHub only and it acts like a clone.
A clone is used locally to create a new repository from an existing one without retaining any linkage.
A branch is used to create a copy of a repository to which it will remain linked.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to perform merges to the remote data while offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

There would be a lot of trading files using various servers or other media.
GitHub/Git would be easier. Trading files would be more difficult.
