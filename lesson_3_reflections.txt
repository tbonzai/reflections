When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with a team, when working from multiple computers, etc.
Basically any time a file or project might invole multiple development computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Becuase the changes might alter or break something you are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is used on GitHub only and it acts like a clone.
A clone is used locally to create a new repository from an existing one without retaining any linkage.
A branch is used to create a copy of a repository to which it will remain linked.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to perform merges to the remote data while offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

There would be a lot of trading files using various servers or other media.
GitHub/Git would be easier. Trading files would be more difficult.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

When you are making major changes or when collaborating with others.
Making the changes in a separate branch prevents you from contaminating the master so that
you can continue to pull changes made by other users to your remote master and merge them into
your branch as you work, thus keeping your branch relatively in sync with the larger project.
Making the changes to the master is much simpler.
