When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with a team, when working from multiple computers, etc.
Basically any time a file or project might invole multiple development computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Becuase the changes might alter or break something you are working on.
