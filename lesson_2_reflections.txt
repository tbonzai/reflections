What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a repository is created in the current directory.
You must initialize so that you can begin tracking files in that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it only contains the
files I have chosen to queue for a commit. It is different from the repository in that is
only contains files I have changed but not yet committed. The value is that it allows me
to bundle changes together, as I see fit, to make a commit.
