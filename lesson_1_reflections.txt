How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It allowed me to see, line by line, the changes between the two documents.
This prevented my from having to flip between two documents or from having to view
them side by side and having to line up the code to compare them. Personally, I
like BeyondCompare much better for comparing files, but I don't think that will
work with commit versions on Git.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can roll back to a prior version if you have an error. You can also see the changes over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, versus having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

You may forget to commit on a regular basis and once you realize you have a problem with the code, the rollback will wipe out a large amount of work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git was created to deal with code development where there is typically an interdependant relationship between files whereas Google Docs was created to deal with papers and presentaions which typically do not have an interdependant relationship.
