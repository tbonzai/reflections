How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It allowed me to see, line by line, the changes between the two documents.
This prevented my from having to flip between two documents or from having to view
them side by side and having to line up the code to compare them. Personally, I
like BeyondCompare much better for comparing files, but I don't think that will
work with commit versions on Git.
